Urutu Rent a Home
=====================================

*Urutu* is a wrapper that fetch all listings from Berlin from 
the [immobilienscout24](http://immobilienscout24.de) in Python.
 
Running Urutu in your machine
------------------------------
Just run the `makefile` that it will install all requirements and execute the wrapper in your machine:

    $ make
    
The output will be two files (an excel file and a csv):
    `immo24_urutu_yyyymmddd_hhmmss.xlsx`
    `immo24_urutu_yyyymmddd_hhmmss.csv`

Why Urutu?
------------------------------
Because I just wanted to honor a typical Brazilian animal species. It has no special meaning. BTW [Urutu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothrops_alternatus) it's a very dangerous snake. If you see any, run away.


Acknowledgements

A special acknowledgement for the user [s0er3n](https://github.com/s0er3n/) for the [elegant solution found](https://github.com/s0er3n/immobilienscout24-scraper/blob/master/immobilienscout24-scraper.py). Immoscout24 changed the main page making the older version of Urutu not working anymore.
